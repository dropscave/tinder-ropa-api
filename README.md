## Tools

### Express

Express is a very lightweight web application framework, so much of its benefits and potential comes from third-party libraries and features. Raising a project and starting to focus on what really interests us is a matter of nothing. For this reason, this framework will be used. Besides that it allows a scalability dependent on the architecture that we use when developing our APIs.

### dotenv

We will use this tool to handle all the environment variables that we need to add to our project.

### nodemon

This tool will allow us to update our application automatically, when making a change in our code. This way we won't have to close and run our API again.

### socket.io

Sokcket.io will help us to implement notifications in real time.
